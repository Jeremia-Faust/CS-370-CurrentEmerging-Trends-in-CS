Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For the final project for this course, I was tasked to create deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem. To create deep Q-learning algorithm, we had to implement Q-Learning using the given code and pseudocode. The first step was to study the code. watch the walkthrough and read all the documentation. The pseudocode was the key to the entire assignment. It gave us a path to complete the deep Q- Learning. The previous assignment of the deep learning with the cartpole was also used to guide me in how to implement the code in the treasure hunt.  The first thing that was important was to figure out all the variables that were used with the rest of the program. This allowed me to understand how everything worked making it easier to implement deep learning. I set up everything I could just using the pseudocode. I was able to get ideas from other methods such as the play game method. This was probably the most difficult to figure out but is how I implemented the if else statements and append the win history and game state. There was a lot if trial and error and was able to get working code and match the sample output. 

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

A computer scientist use technology to solve problems. For this class we studied AI and deep learning neural networks. AI is ever changing technology for which computer scientists are using to solve many problems in the world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

To solve a problem as a computer scientist the first step would be to identify the problem that you are trying to solve. This is not always obvious as sometimes you have to look deeper in the problem to find the root cause of the problem. Once you figured out the problem you need to gather as much information as possible. This information allows for you to create a solution. Creating a solution will happen over many iterations with each iteration getting closer to solve the problem. Finally, the solution is tested to see if it solves the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibility is to create safe products that will keep the safety and security of our end users and the organization I am currently working for. In the lens of AI, we need to be careful of what bias an AI develops with the data introduced. When implementing AI, we need to follow the guidelines set forth by rule set forth by the different governing bodies around the world. Lastly AI should never be developed to hurt or steal from others.
